1. G-COST: The g value calculates is the total number of titles to get to the
cake when it takes the path of avoiding lava (Exhibit A)

2. H-COST: The smallest value to get to the cake without factoring lava.
In this value, the count starts from the cake and works backwards to get
to Paul (Exhibit C)

3. F-COST: is the sum of the h and g values. When you hit the spacebar you will
see the F-score on the tiles.
